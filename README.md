## About Company

- AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities 

  **1.Surat**

  **2.Ahmedabad**

  **3.Vadodara**

  ***
## Problem Statement

- AtliQ Mart aims to expand its operations to other metro cities within the next two years.
- However, the company is currently facing a critical challenge. Several key customers have not renewed their annual contracts due to service issues.
- These problems are mainly related to the delivery of essential products. 
- On several occasions, these products were either not delivered **On Time** or not delivered **In Full** over an extended period.
- This has resulted in poor customer service and dissatisfaction.

***
## Management request

- Management has identified service issues and aims to address them before expanding to new cities. 
- They have instructed the supply chain analytics team to monitor daily **On-time** and **In Full** delivery service levels for all customers to enable prompt issue resolution.

***
## Key service metrics

- The Supply Chain team employs a standardized approach for measuring service levels.
- Key metrics include

  **Total Orders**
  
   **Total Orders Lines**

   **On-time delivery (OT)%**

   **In-full delivery(IF)%**

   **Line Fill Rate (LIFR)%**

   **Volume Fill Rate (VOFR)%**
- The team monitors **Total Order** and **Total Order Lines** for daily customer orders.
- These metrics are compared against the target service levels established for each customer.

## My Role in this project

- Ahmedabad, Surat, and Vadodara are not meeting the targets for On-time Delivery (OT%) and On Time in Full (OTIF%), highlighting performance gaps in these areas.

- The primary focus should be on enhancing OT% and OTIF% to improve overall service quality and avoid customer dissatisfaction.

- Operational adjustments might be necessary to ensure orders are delivered on time and in full, aligning with the established targets.

- Some products may not be fully delivered (LIFR%: 66%), while most of the ordered volume is fulfilled (VOFR%: 97%).

- Understanding why certain products face delivery issues, such as order processing or stock availability, can improve overall delivery.

- To enhance efficiency, we'll optimize processes and improve communication with suppliers, using these insights keep refining our processes for ongoing enhancement.
